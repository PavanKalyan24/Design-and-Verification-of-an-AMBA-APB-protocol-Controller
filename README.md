# AMBA-APB-Protocol Design
◦ The APB bus is designed using the Verilog HDL according to the specification and is verified using EDAplaground.  
◦ The simulation results show that the data read from a particular memory location is same as the data written to the given memory location.  
◦ The results obtained after the simulation will be compared with the results.
