# AMBA-APB-Protocol Design

* The APB bus is implemented in Verilog HDL according to the specifications and tested using EDA Playground.
* The simulation demonstrates that the value read from a memory address is identical to the value written into that address.
* The simulation outputs will be compared with the expected results.
